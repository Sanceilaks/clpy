# Clpy ðŸ“‹

Save copied image from clipboard as an image file directly from your command line!

#### Note

It works only on windows as of now. I'll be adding support for other platforms soon!

## Usage

![image](./.github/example.gif)

    cargo install --git https://github.com/PiyushSuthar/clpy.git

Now you can use it as a command line tool.

    clpy [file_name]
